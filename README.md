# Car-Sales-and-Market-Trends
This project combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning modeling** to understand the used car market and predict car selling prices.

## Objectives
1. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Explore key insights (trends, correlations, distributions)  
3. Build predictive models (Linear Regression)  
4. Evaluate model performance  

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Vehicle Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data)  
- Size: 500,000+ records  
- Features: year, brand, model, trim, body, transmission, state, condition, odometer, color, interior, seller, mmr, selling price, saledate.  

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Tableau (for dashboard visualization)  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate Analysis (Histogram) of Numerical Feature ![Alt Text](https://github.com/alifautari/Car-Sales-and-Market-Trends/blob/main/output/Univariate%20Analysis%20of%20Numerical%20Features.jpg)
- Univariate Analysis (Bar) of Categorical Feature ![Alt Text](https://github.com/alifautari/Car-Sales-and-Market-Trends/blob/main/output/Univariate%20Analysis%20of%20Categorical%20Features.jpg)
- Multivariate Analysis (Correlation of Numerical Features) ![Alt Text](https://github.com/alifautari/Car-Sales-and-Market-Trends/blob/main/output/Multivariate%20Analysis%20(Correlation%20of%20Numerical%20Features).jpg)
- Distribution of car prices (boxplot)  
- Relationship between odometer and price  
- Effect of condition and MMR

## Visualization
- Trends of Monthly Sales Revenue (Top 10 Brands)
- Top 10 Most Popular Cars (Brand-Model)
- Top 10 Cars by Total Sales Revenue
- Treemap of top cars models by total revenue
- Scatterplot of Car Selling Price vs Manufacturing Year by Brand

## Modeling
- Linear Regression  
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²  

## Results
- Key insights: Car prices are mainly influenced by condition and MMR.
